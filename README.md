Final Analysis
----
List of types of delays descending:
carrier, late aircraft, NAS, weather and security

According to the data, it seems that smaller airports tend to have higher delays. That may be due to the number of employees and if they are equiped and prepared for inclement weather. The max average amount of time in mins for delays is approximately 30 mins. On January 11th, 2023, there was a spike in delays due to flights being grounded by the FAA due to a system outage. Wednesdays have the highest delay times and Saturdays have the least delay times.Throughout the day, delay times are lowest from midnight to morning. Then delay time rises from morning into the night.
